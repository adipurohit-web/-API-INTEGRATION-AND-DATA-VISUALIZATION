## üìñ Project Overview
This task was assigned as part of my internship at **Codtech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.** in the domain of **Python Programming**. The goal of the project was to work with a **public API** (such as OpenWeatherMap) to fetch live or sample data, process it, and then create meaningful **data visualizations** using Python libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  

The task was designed to give me practical exposure to **real-world data handling, API integration, and visualization techniques**. Working with APIs is an essential skill for Python developers, as it allows applications to interact with external services and data sources. Meanwhile, data visualization is a core part of analytics and helps transform raw numbers into insights.

## üéØ Objectives
1. Understand how to connect and fetch data from a public API.  
2. Process and clean the retrieved data for analysis.  
3. Create visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
4. Save or display the output graphs for interpretation.  
5. Document the workflow in a structured manner.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details
The project was implemented in **Python**. The main steps followed were:  

1. **API Integration:**  
   - I used the `requests` library to connect to the API endpoint and fetch JSON data.  
   - For example, with OpenWeatherMap, I fetched details such as **temperature, humidity, and weather conditions** for specific cities.  

2. **Data Processing:**  
   - The JSON data received was parsed into Python dictionaries.  
   - I extracted relevant fields and organized them into a structured format (using Pandas DataFrame for convenience).  

3. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Using **Matplotlib**, I created bar charts and line graphs to show variations such as temperature trends.  
   - With **Seaborn**, I generated more advanced plots such as scatter plots and heatmaps for better insights.  

4. **Output Generation:**  
   - The generated visualizations were displayed and also saved as `.png` files for later use.  
   - Example: `output_visualization.png`.

## üìä Sample Outputs
- Bar charts showing weather conditions across multiple cities.  
- Line charts depicting temperature variations over time.  
- Scatter plots for analyzing relationships between humidity and temperature.  

*(Screenshots of these graphs can be added here once saved.)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Python**  
- **Requests** (for API calls)  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib** (for basic plotting)  
- **Seaborn** (for advanced visualizations)

## üìö Learning Outcomes
This task was extremely helpful in strengthening my understanding of:  
- How APIs work and how to interact with them using Python.  
- How to parse and clean JSON data for analysis.  
- The basics of data visualization and the importance of choosing the right chart for the data.  
- How libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** complement each other.  
- The real-world workflow of fetching, analyzing, and presenting data in a meaningful way.  

This task also helped me improve my coding style by following best practices such as writing clean code, adding comments, and structuring my scripts logically.
